# Proposal: Template Aesthetics Extension

This proposal aims to enhance the visual quality and interactivity of the presentation template by migrating premium styles from `presentazione-tmp.html`.

## Why
The current template, while functional, lacks the premium feel and dynamic interactions found in modern presentation tools. By incorporating staggered animations and richer visual effects, we can significantly improve the user experience and perceived value of the generated slides.

## Goals
- Implement a staggered animation system for slide content.
- Enhance backgroud effects with richer gradients.
- Improve Hero Slide layout and typography for better visual impact.
- Add utility components like `highlight-box`.
- Improve overall typography and spacing for a premium feel.

## Capabilities
- **Animation System**: Staggered fade-up animations for cards, lists, and headings.
- **Enhanced Background**: Multi-layered radial gradients for a more dynamic look.
- **Utility Components**: Specific CSS classes for highlighted summaries.
